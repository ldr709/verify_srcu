Formal verification of Sleepable Read-copy-update using CBMC.

To run the tests, use the following commands.
autoreconf --install # (If you got the code from git and not a tarball)
./configure --with-linux=<Path to linux kernel source>
make
make check -j<Number of threads>

Currently this code checks an included version of SRCU. Eventually it will be
able to use an external implementation of SRCU.

You may want to pass CFLAGS to configure to enable compiler warnings. I
recommend using
CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -O2"

The following environment variables specific to this code may be passed to
make check.
CBMC: The command to run CBMC. Default: cbmc
CBMC_FLAGS: Additional flags to pass to CBMC.
NR_CPUS: Number of cpus to run tests with. Default varies depending on the test.

Generic options for make check are listed in
